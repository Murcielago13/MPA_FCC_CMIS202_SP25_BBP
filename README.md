[Leaderboard System] 

(*Who is this for?*)

This software is for game developers, students, and hobbyists who want to integrate a simple high score or leaderboard system into their games or applications.  

(*What is the purpose?*) 

The purpose of this software is to track and display player scores in a sorted leaderboard. It saves player names, scores, and the date the score was achieved.  

(*Where and When is it used?*)

This can be used in desktop-based Java games or learning environments where keeping a persistent record of scores is necessary. It is designed to run on any desktop with Java installed and can be used after each game session or during game runtime.  

(*How does it work?*)

Players enter their name and score into a simple GUI.  Scores are saved to a local file.  The leaderboard reads this file, sorts the entries using Merge Sort, and displays the top scores.  

(*Why use this system?*)

Easy to integrate and customize.  Uses efficient sorting and good object-oriented design with inheritance and generics.  Provides persistent file storage without needing a database.  Useful learning tool for Java, OOP, GUI, file I/O, and algorithms.
